## Overview
This smart contract enables organizations to issue NFT-based memberships that can be verified on-chain. Memberships can be minted, revoked, and checked for validity.

## Features
- **NFT-based Memberships:** Each membership is represented as a unique NFT.
- **Minting & Revoking:** The contract owner can create and remove memberships.
- **Access Control:** Only the contract owner can issue or revoke memberships.
- **Ownership Tracking:** Members can verify their NFT ownership.

## Smart Contract Details
- **Solidity Version:** ^0.8.9
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum-compatible networks
- **Token Standard:** Custom (simplified NFT functionality)
- **Access Control:** OnlyOwner modifier restricts key functions

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nft-memberships.git
   cd nft-memberships
   ```
2. Compile the contract:
   ```sh
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

## Usage
- **Deploy the contract** using a blockchain development environment.
- **Mint a membership:**
   ```solidity
   mintMembership(address member);
   ```
- **Revoke a membership:**
   ```solidity
   revokeMembership(uint256 tokenId);
   ```
- **Check membership status:**
   ```solidity
   isMembershipActive(uint256 tokenId);
   ```

## Functions
- `mintMembership(address to)`: Mints a new membership NFT to the specified address.
- `revokeMembership(uint256 tokenId)`: Revokes the specified membership NFT.
- `isMembershipActive(uint256 tokenId)`: Checks if a membership is active.
- `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the owner of the given membership token.
- `balanceOf(address member)`: Returns the number of memberships owned by an address.

## Security Considerations
- Ensure only the contract owner can mint or revoke memberships.
- Prevent unauthorized changes to membership status.
- Regularly audit the smart contract for vulnerabilities.
